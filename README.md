# A technical test

A code review done in a Django Rest Framework project

# Which files should you look for to check my code review and my own take on the subject?

TODO: add the direct link each file once it's available on github
* src/myuser/views_original.py: The original file, available at the given [gist](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jbma/3b7e26c595f2e4c05525b0d70f4b3605/raw/ca54b46d8df6694daab596fe246a5cd404b3c30a/views.py)
* src/myuser/views_code_review.py: The original file, but with my comments for each code snippet that deserved my evaluation.
* src/myuser/views.py: My take on it, displaying how I would write the views module

# How to run the project:
    $ git clone <github_url>
    $ cd <project_dir>
    $ docker-compose up

To login, use the already available user: "admin" and password: "admin"

The only dependency needed to run it is docker (and docker-compose)

##  What's in code_review project?

* Django 2.2
* Django Rest Framework 3.10
